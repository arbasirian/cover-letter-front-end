          Over the past six years, I have worked with many small and big teams
          so I have learned how to communicate with my teammates and teamwork
          with my coworkers as well. I bring a comprehensive set of skills in
          Frontend Development using React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and
          CSS that I believe will be useful for {data.company}. My teamwork,
          collaboration, ability to Research-and-Development, and interest in
          learning new things have afforded me excellent problem-solving skills
          in creative ways. I am excited to contribute my talents and
          proficiency in communication to your team's efforts.
